Since I've discovered this website, **dev.to** has been my favorite platform for getting and sharing content with the community. I fell in love with dev.to for dev content, just like I fell in love with GitHub for open source development. And when I love something, I have to give back ♥️.

My way to give back to this wonderful community is to present you a new CLI made for dev.to authors.

## What is this new CLI?

## What can I use it for?

## Setting up a GitHub repo synchronized with dev.to


## Want to contribute?


### Future plans



Thanks for being here and taking part in this
