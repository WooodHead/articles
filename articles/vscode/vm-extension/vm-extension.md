Last week [a new extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-azurevirtualmachines&WT.mc_id=devto-blog-yolasors) has been launched for [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com?WT.mc_id=devto-blog-yolasors), allowing you to quickly create, manage and connect to [Azure Virtual Machines](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/virtual-machines/?WT.mc_id=devto-blog-yolasors) (VMs) right from within the editor! üéâ

Here's a short 1 minute video I made to illustrate how easy it is to create and connect to a new VM:

Obviously this is not made for production work, but for development it can be quite useful. I work on cross-platform OSS packages all the time, and being able to quickly spawn and connect to a remote Linux VM without having to leave my current workflow is a real time saver for testing and bug fixing üòç.

What do you think about it?

*Note: this extension is currently in preview and some features may be currently missing, like the ability to choose which kind of VM/Size to create.*
